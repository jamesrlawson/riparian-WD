Fit linear, quadratic and exponential models to all hydro metrics

Output dataframe with p values and r squared for each model
	- use ldply

Manually add column with value describing multiple comparsion group (1 = floods, 2 = unpredictability)

Run BH p-value adjustment using ddply by multiple comparison group, append output to dataframe

Inspect output and manually add column 'fit' with values 1, 2, 3 (corresponding to whether linear, quadratic or exponential model gives the best fit)

Graph according to fit == 1, else fit == 2, else fit == 3
	- use different pch for each hydrological class
